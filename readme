POST /v1/batch/jobs: You upload your JSON file (which should contain a list of ChatCompletionRequest objects). The server accepts it, assigns a job_id, and immediately returns, while starting the processing in the background.

GET /v1/batch/jobs/{job_id}: You use this to check the status ("pending", "processing", "completed", or "failed").

GET /v1/batch/jobs/{job_id}/results: Once the status is "completed", you call this to download the final JSON response file.
